        <div class="aboutme">
            I am a freelance graphic designer and 2D artist, currently studying at Towson University in Baltimore seeking a BA in Graphic Design with a minor in Computer Science. I have been working with startups and clients for the last two years, on projects ranging from concept art to business identity and corporate work. 
            <br><br>
            My multicultural background has shaped my view of art and design as a tool to communicate effectively with my peers and my surroundings. Moving often during my formative years strengthened my ability to adapt, which has become an effective tool for dealing with tough challenges that arise in projects. 
            <br><br>
            Working in this field has been one of the most rewarding and inspiring experiences of my life and I look forward to learning every day, and expanding my boundaries in design and creativity.
