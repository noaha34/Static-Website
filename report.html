            1. I created this website for my friend who is a graphic designer studying at Towson. I took info from what he sent me as well as his current portfolio website.
            <br>
            2. No images or content other than the images my friend sent me are included in this site. The social media icons adhere to their usage policy of linking only to their site.
            <br>
            3. My site contains 5 pages, the main index page, the about me page, the contact page, the past projects page, and the pricing page. Index is loaded by default.
            <br>
            4. My site includes a header.
            <br>
            5. My site includes navigation links through a dropdown menu, index can be accessed by clicking the name logo.
            <br>
            6. My multicolumn form on the contact page utilizes a media query to shrink to one column on smaller displays like mobile. part of the text fields are cut off though.
            <br>
            7. My site retains coherent style across all pages, I have one parent style sheet that is used for the whole site (including this page) and then individual style sheets for each page.
            <br>
            8. My site includes images that all include alt attributes that accurately describe the image.
            <br>
            9. Each page declares its favicon and is displayed.
            <br>
            10. All my non HTML resources are organized into directories images and css. My javaswcript is minimal and is included at the bottom of my html with script tags.
            <br>
            11. I do not use any third party libraries or frameworks, I reimplemented ideas I saw on W3 schools though.
            <br>
