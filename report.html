            1. I created this website for my friend who is a graphic designer studying at Towson. I took info from what he sent me as well as his current portfolio website.
            <br>
            2. No images or content other than the images my friend sent me are included in this site. The social media icons adhere to their usage policy of linking only to their site.

            3. My site contains 5 pages, the main index page, the about me page, the contact page, the past projects page, and the pricing page. Index is loaded by default.

            <br>
            6. My multicolumn form on the contact page utilizes a media query to shrink to one column on smaller displays like mobile. part of the text fields are cut off though.
            <br>
            7. My site retains coherent style across all pages, I have one parent style sheet that is used for the whole site (including this page) and then individual style sheets for each page.
            <br>
            8. My site includes images that all include alt attributes that accurately describe the image.

            9. Each page declares its favicon and is displayed.
            <br>
            10. All my non HTML resources are organized into directories images and css. My javaswcript is minimal and is included at the bottom of my html with script tags.
            <br>
            11. I do not use any third party libraries or frameworks, I reimplemented ideas I saw on W3 schools though.
            <br>
            12. My code contains some errors in Nu that I were unable to completely eliminate.
            <br>
            13. The content is neatly aligned on the page with clear margins on pages. It is left aligned as that is where the menu button is.
            <br>

            <br>
            17. My source code is readable with accurate spacing that can easily be edited, and follows conventional formatting. My names for my classes and ids represent the element they are effecting.
            <br>
            18. My site includes an animation on the home page (index) when the images are navigated there is a fade in effect that smoothes out the transition between slides. It is also trigerred on opening the website.

            My client is a graphical designer and his portfolio aesthetic is very important to his image. Prior to the project he had a website already working that he decided that he is going to continue to use. He was however impressed
            with my novice ability to sculpt this website from scratch, as the one that he had was created using an engine like wordpress. He likes the creative direction I took the website in and really likes the homepage and said that may
            implement the style of displaying images similar to how I did on the home page. Overall my client (friend) John is happy with the work I did for him, but realizes there is much room for improvement within the site.
